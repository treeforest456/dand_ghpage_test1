# Exploratory Data Analysis of BigMart Sales Dataset
This is one of the project from Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Project Overview
This is a dataset created by the data scientists at BigMart.
They have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in
different cities. 
Here I use this dataset to do a data exploration using R. I performed some 
visualization of some of the features, including uni-variable, bi-variable and
multi-variable analysis.

## Steps
1. Loading data
2. Checking missing values
3. Data visualizations and thinking of the plots

## Files
* sales_prediction.html -------------------- generated html file from Rmd
* sales_prediction.rmd --------------------- original Rmd file
* train_data.csv --------------------------- explored dataset
